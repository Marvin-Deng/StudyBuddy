## About

### Description and Purpose
TutorMe is a web app that connects students who need help to experienced tutors who are willing to help other students. The website will be free to use, and tutors will not get paid.

### Inspiration
Many university students struggle with their classes but don't know who to ask. TutorMe would streamline the process of connecting struggling students with tutors.
