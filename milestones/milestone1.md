## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Once we got our idea, everything else came naturally. We were able to seamlessly write up ideas and user stories for our projects.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge we faced was deciding on what our website should be about. We both realized that often we lack someone to help us out with school assignments, so creating a platform where tutor matching becomes easier should help others out.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We will definetly need to consult sources for our tech stack. Some sources that we can use are the past codepath labs, and official documentation.
